      <h2 id="initialsetup">Setting Up Textual For The First Time</h2>

      <p>
        Textual is incredibly easy to get going. If you're a new user, when you
        first start Textual, it will prompt you to enter a new server to
        connect to.
      </p>

      <img src="images/textual/02-enter-a-server.png"
        alt="Connecting to a new server">

      <p>
        <strong>IRC server:</strong> For the Desert Bus Chat, make sure this is
        set to <samp>irc.desertbus.org</samp>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Nickname:</strong> Enter whatever name you'd like to use in the
        chat. If you have a donor account, you'll be able to reserve this name
        for later, and no one else will be able to use it when you disconnect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Channels:</strong> You don't need to worry about this, because
        the Desert Bus IRC server will automatically connect you to the main
        room, <samp>#desertbus</samp>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Connect on launch</strong> If you'd like to save yourself some
        time, and connect to the Desert Bus Chat whenever you start Textual,
        leave this option checked (it's on by default).
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you've filled in all these fields, the Start Chatting button
        should become enabled, so go ahead and click that.
      </p>

      <img src="images/textual/03-connected.png"
        alt="Connecting for the first time">

      <p>
        You should see Textual connect to the server. Once it's connected, click
        on the arrow next to the server's name in the sidebar to expand it. If
        everything went correctly, you should see <samp>#desertbus</samp> there.
      </p>

      <h2 id="autoconnect">Connecting Automatically on Startup</h2>

      <p>
        If you didn't choose to let Textual automatically connect when it
        launches, or you want to turn off the automatic connection, you can
        change the settings on the main configuration screen for the Desert Bus
        server. Simply check or uncheck
        <strong>Connect when Textual opens</strong> to change this option.
      </p>

      <h2 id="identification">Automatically Identifying Yourself to the Server</h2>

      <p>
        If you have a donor account (and you should! How else will you bid on
        the live auctions? Or get your name in for a chance to win prizes from
        the donation challenges?), you can link your account with your
        nickname in chat. The easiest method for this in Textual is to use
        its <strong>Connect Commands</strong>. Open the server configuration
        screen by hitting <samp>Cmd+U</samp>. Click on the
        <strong>Connect Commands</strong> configuration item on the left, and
        fill in the box labelled <strong>Perform commands on connect:</strong>
        with the command below, replacing the email address and password with
        your donor account ones.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <samp>/msg NickServ login &lt;email address&gt; &lt;password&gt;</samp>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="hidejoinpart">Hiding Join and Part Messages in Textual</h2>

      <p>
        There are a <strong>lot</strong> of people in the Desert Bus Chat
        during the marathon, so there are also a lot of people joining and
        leaving. Normally you might want to know who just left the channel
        you're in, but it can quickly become overwhelming during Desert Bus.
      </p>

      <p>
        To disable these messages, you'll need to change the option in the
        channel configuration screen. To get there, click on
        <samp>#desertbus</samp> in the sidebar, then hit <samp>Cmd+I</samp>, or
        the gear icon in the lower left, then <strong>Channel Properties</strong>.
      </p>

        alt="Configuration screen for a specific channel">

      <p>
        Once you've reached the options for the channel, the join/part
        messages can be easily disabled by checking
        <strong>Disable join, part, and quit activity</strong> and hitting
        <strong>Save</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="sslsetup">Connecting to Desert Bus Chat Securely</h2>

      <p>
        Making Textual connect to the Desert Bus server with SSL is also very
        simple. Press <samp>Cmd+U</samp> to open the server configuration
        window, and you should automatically be focused on <strong>General</strong>
        configuration. To enable SSL, change the <strong>Port:</strong> to
        <strong>6697</strong>, and check the <strong>Use SSL</strong> box. Make
        sure to <strong>Save</strong>.  Re-connect to the server and you should
        now be connected over SSL.
      <p>
