      <h1>Using Textual to Access the Desert Bus Chat</h1>

      <p>
        Textual is an IRC client for OS X which is simple and easy to use. You
        can purchase it from the
        <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textual-irc-client/id403012667">App Store</a>
        or download a trial from
        <a href="http://www.codeux.com/textual/">the developer's site</a>.
        The current version at the moment of writing 3.2.3.
      </p>

      <h2>A Note About Security and Identification</h2>

      <p>
        There are three ways to identify yourself to the Desert Bus Chat
        server: NickServ, server password, or SASL. In Textual's case, all
        three are about the same in terms of security*, but SASL is preferred,
        and is explained in <a href="#identification">Identifying Yourself</a>.
        No matter which option you choose, you should also review
        <a href="#sslsetup">Connecting Securely</a>
        for instructions on using SSL to secure your connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        <small>
          * Normally SASL is more secure, but Textual only supports SASL PLAIN,
          which doesn't encrypt your data when you're sending it to the server.
          Make sure to connect using SSL if you're concerned about this. In the
          future Textual might support some form of encryption, in which case
          you'll already be set.
        </small>

      <h2 id="initialsetup">Setting Up Textual For The First Time</h2>

      <img src="images/textual/01-first-time.png"
        alt="What you should see when you first open Textual">

      <p>
        Textual is incredibly easy to get going. If you're a new user, when you
        first start Textual, it will prompt you to enter a new server to
        connect to.
      </p>

      <img src="images/textual/02-enter-a-server.png"
        alt="Connecting to a new server">

      <p>
        <strong>IRC server:</strong> For the Desert Bus Chat, make sure this is
        set to <samp>irc.desertbus.org</samp>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Nickname:</strong> Enter whatever name you'd like to use in the
        chat. If you have a donor account, you'll be able to reserve this name
        for later, and no one else will be able to use it when you disconnect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Channels:</strong> You don't need to worry about this, because
        the Desert Bus IRC server will automatically connect you to the main
        room, <samp>#desertbus</samp>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Connect on launch</strong> If you'd like to save yourself some
        time, and connect to the Desert Bus Chat whenever you start Textual,
        leave this option checked (it's on by default).
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you've filled in all these fields, the Start Chatting button
        should become enabled, so go ahead and click that.
      </p>

      <img src="images/textual/03-connected.png"
        alt="Connecting for the first time">

      <p>
        You should see Textual connect to the server. Once it's connected, click
        on the arrow next to the server's name in the sidebar to expand it. If
        everything went correctly, you should see <samp>#desertbus</samp> there.
      </p>

      <img src="images/textual/04-in-channel.png"
        alt="Clicking on #desertbus should bring you to the main chat">

      <p>
        If for some reason <samp>#desertbus</samp> isn't there, make sure you
        connected to the server successfully. If that's not the problem, just
        type <samp>/join #desertbus</samp> in the text box you see in the main
        window, then hit <strong>Return</strong>, and hopefully you'll be
        connected to the chat.
      </p>

      <h2 id="autoconnect">Connecting Automatically on Startup</h2>

      <p>
        If you didn't choose to let Textual automatically connect when it
        launches, or you want to turn off the automatic connection, you can
        change the settings on the main configuration screen for the Desert Bus
        server. Simply check or uncheck
        <strong>Connect when Textual opens</strong> to change this option.
      </p>

        alt="The main configuration screen for the server">

      <h2 id="identification">Automatically Identifying Yourself to the Server</h2>

      <p>
        If you have a donor account, you can link your account with your
        nickname in chat. The preferred method for this is SASL, which is very
        easy to set up using Textual. Open the server configuration screen by
        hitting <samp>Cmd+U</samp>. Click on the <strong>Identity</strong>
        configuration item on the left, and fill in the box labelled
        <strong>Personal Password</strong>.
      </p>

      <img src="images/textual/06-personal-details.png"
        alt="">

      <p>
        Your password for SASL is not just the password for your donor account,
        you also need to include the email address you used for the
        account. The format for the password is:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <samp>&lt;email address&gt; &lt;password&gt;</samp>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        or
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <samp>&lt;email address&gt;:&lt;password&gt;</samp>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        with a colon. Once you hit save, re-connect to the Desert Bus server and
        you should automatically authenticate. This has the added benefit of
        saving your nickname so that others can't take it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="hidejoinpart">Hiding Join and Part Messages in Textual</h2>

      <p>
        There are a <strong>lot</strong> of people in the Desert Bus Chat
        during the marathon, so there are also a lot of people joining and
        leaving. Normally you might want to know who just left the channel
        you're in, but it can quickly become overwhelming during Desert Bus.
      </p>

      <p>
        To disable these message, you'll need to change the option in the
        channel configuration screen. To get there, click on
        <samp>#desertbus</samp> in the sidebar, then hit <samp>Cmd+I</samp>, or
        the gear icon in the lower left, then <strong>Channel Properties</strong>.
      </p>

      <img src="images/textual/07-channel-details.png"
        alt="Configuration screen for a specific channel">

      <p>
        Once you've reached the options for the channel, the join/part
        messages can be easily disabled by checking
        <strong>Disable join, part, and quit activity</strong> and hitting
        <strong>Save</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="sslsetup">Connecting to Desert Bus Chat Securely</h2>

      <p>
        Making Textual connect to the Desert Bus server with SSL is also very
        simple. Press <samp>Cmd+U</samp> to open the server configuration
        window, and you should automatically be focused on <strong>General</strong>
        configuration. To enable SSL, just check the <strong>Use SSL</strong>
        box next to <strong>Port</strong> and make sure to <strong>Save</strong>.
        Re-connect to the server and you should be using SSL automatically.
      <p>
